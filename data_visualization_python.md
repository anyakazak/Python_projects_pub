## Task: Working with Pandas datasets and visualization in Python

Facebook Ad Campaign Statistics Data: **facebook_ads_data.csv**

1. Group the data by day and create two plots for the grouped data:
- a plot showing the daily total spend for 2021;
- a plot showing the daily ROMI for 2021;
- **Bonus**: Apply the rolling() method to show the moving average of spend and ROMI.
  
2. Group the data by campaign name and create two plots:
- a plot showing the total spend per campaign;
- a plot showing the overall ROMI for each campaign.
  
3. Use a box plot to determine the spread of daily ROMI within each campaign (by campaign name).

4. Create a histogram to show the distribution of ROMI values in the facebook_ads_data.csv table.

5. Build a heatmap of the correlation between all numerical metrics in the facebook_ads_data.csv table.
  Which metrics have the highest and lowest correlations?
  What does "total_value" correlate with?

6. Create a scatter plot with linear regression (you can use lmplot()) for "total_spend" and "total_value" to visualize the relationship between these variables.
